2	Identify and mitigate vulnerabilities, and, where appropriate, incidents and patterns of misuse, after deployment including placement on the market. 
 
Organizations should use, as and when appropriate commensurate to the level of risk, AI systems as intended and monitor for vulnerabilities, incidents, emerging risks and misuse after deployment, and take appropriate action to address these. Organizations are encouraged to consider, for example, facilitating third-party and user discovery and reporting of issues and vulnerabilities after deployment such as through bounty systems, contests, or prizes to incentivize the responsible disclosure of weaknesses. Organizations are further encouraged to maintain appropriate documentation of reported incidents and to mitigate the identified risks and vulnerabilities, in collaboration with other stakeholders. Mechanisms to report vulnerabilities, where appropriate, should be accessible to a diverse set of stakeholders.
