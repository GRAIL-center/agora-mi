Article 74	Biometric Recognition

The use of AI to process biometric information shall have a specific purpose and sufficient necessity, and strict protection measures shall be adopted. Where there exist other non-biometric technical solutions that can achieve the same purpose or meet the same business requirements, preference shall be given to non-biometric technical solutions.

If the biometric information generated by AI is used maliciously or has the possibility of identifying a specific natural person, upon the request of the rights holder, the AI provider shall take necessary measures such as blocking, breaking links, and information deletion.

CHAPTER II: PROHIBITED AI PRACTICES

Article 5: Prohibited AI practices

1.   The following AI practices shall be prohibited:

(a)	the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that deploys subliminal techniques beyond a person’s consciousness or purposefully manipulative or deceptive techniques, with the objective, or the effect of materially distorting the behaviour of a person or a group of persons by appreciably impairing their ability to make an informed decision, thereby causing them to take a decision that they would not have otherwise taken in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person, another person or group of persons significant harm;

(b)	the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of an AI system that exploits any of the vulnerabilities of a natural person or a specific group of persons due to their age, disability or a specific social or economic situation, with the objective, or the effect, of materially distorting the behaviour of that person or a person belonging to that group in a manner that causes or is reasonably likely to cause that person or another person significant harm;

(c)	the placing on the market, the putting into service or the use of AI systems for the evaluation or classification of natural persons or groups of persons over a certain period of time based on their social behaviour or known, inferred or predicted personal or personality characteristics, with the social score leading to either or both of the following:

(i)	detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons in social contexts that are unrelated to the contexts in which the data was originally generated or collected;

(ii)	detrimental or unfavourable treatment of certain natural persons or groups of persons that is unjustified or disproportionate to their social behaviour or its gravity;
