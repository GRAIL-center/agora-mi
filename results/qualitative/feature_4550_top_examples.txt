Data Protection Laws Provide Additional Broad Protections for Californians
Data is the bedrock underlying the massive growth in AI, and Californians’ broad privacy and data rights directly
impact AI systems, whether through the data used to build and train AI, or through the information that may be
exposed by AI outputs.
Californians possess a constitutional right to privacy that applies to both government and private entities. (Hill
v. National Collegiate Athletic Assn. (1994) 7 Cal.4th 1, 20.) Informational privacy, i.e., the “interest in precluding
the dissemination or misuse of sensitive and confidential information” is a core privacy interest protected by the
California Constitution. (Id. at 35.) Developers and entities that use AI must carefully monitor AI systems’ training
data, inputs, and outputs to ensure that Californians’ constitutional right to privacy is respected.
The California Consumer Privacy Act (CCPA) broadly regulates the collection, use, sale, and sharing of consumers’
personal information, including heightened protections for sensitive personal information. Personal information
may also include inferences about consumers made by AI systems. (See Civ. Code, § 1798.140(v).) CCPA grants
consumers important rights:
• The right to know about the personal information a business collects about them, and how it is used and
shared;
• The right to correct inaccurate personal information that a business has about them;
• The right to delete personal information collected about them (with some exceptions);
• The right to opt out of the sale or sharing of their personal information; and
• The right to limit the use and disclosure of their sensitive personal information. (Id. § 1798.100 et seq.)
