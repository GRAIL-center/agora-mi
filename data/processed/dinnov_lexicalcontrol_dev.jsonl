AI use in military contexts shall adhere to the principles and measures articulated in the Political Declaration on Responsible Military Use of Artificial Intelligence and Autonomy, announced by the United States on November 9, 2023.\n\nThis AI Framework includes four primary pillars relating to:\n1. Identifying restricted and “high-impact” AI use cases based on risk they pose to national security, international norms, democratic values, human rights, civil rights, civil liberties, privacy, or safety, as well as AI use cases that impact Federal personnel.\n2. Creating sufficiently robust minimum-risk management practices for those categories of AI that are identified as high impact, including pre-deployment risk assessments.\n3. Cataloguing and monitoring high-impact AI use.\n4. Ensuring effective training and accountability mechanisms.\n\nThe AI Framework is complementary to, but does not otherwise replace or modify, OMB Memorandum M-24-10. All AI use by federal agencies shall be governed by either OMB Memorandum M-24-10 and its successor policies or by this AI Framework. This AI Framework covers AI when it is being used as a component of an NSS.

{"id": "1808_24", "doc_id": "1808", "text": "6 AI Lifecycles\n\nIntroduction\n\n132. There are a number of AI development and use lifecycle concepts with the most common being aligned to the DevOps (a conjunction of Development and Operations) philosophy. DevOps seeks to speed up software releases through a continual highly automated process. The continuous nature of DevOps can make them problematic for dependable systems because technical debt15 often arises due to planning and coding already being in progress whilst test and deployment monitoring are ongoing for earlier releases.\n\n133. There are a number of variations on the DevOps, for example DevSecOps, which push security characteristics into the lifecycle. Of particular relevance to the development of AI (ML specifically) is the variant known as MLOps (Machine Learning + DevOps); see Figure \n4. In the MLOps lifecycle, algorithms are created that then have data applied to them (training) to produce models that are then verified. All of the model elements are then packaged and released for deployment. Once deployed, the model will have input data applied and outputs inferred based on the functional approximation within the model. The performance of the model is monitored with new data often collected ready for the next\ncycle. This monitoring phase can be considered as continual validation of the ML in the context of use.\n\n15 Technical debt is where choices to develop technology at speed leads to gradual reductions in design quality. The longer the debt is accrued, the more difficult and expensive it is to fix and higher the likelihood of failure becomes.\n\n134. This JSP does not require, or advocate, any one lifecycle over any others that may exist. A lifecycle that is appropriate for a digital system may not be appropriate for RAS. The lifecycle adopted should be appropriate to the context that the AI will reside. Guidance on AI Lifecycles will be provided in Part 2.
