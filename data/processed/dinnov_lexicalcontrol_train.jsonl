Young\nSUBJECT: Advancing Governance, advancement, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence\nArtificial intelligence (AI) is one of the most powerful technologies of our time, and the President has been clear that we must seize the opportunities AI presents while managing its risks. Consistent with the AI in Government Act of 2020,1 the Advancing American AI Act,2 and Executive Order 14110 on the Safe, Secure, and Trustworthy Development and Use of Artificial Intelligence, this memorandum directs agencies to advance AI governance and advancement while managing risks from the use of AI in the Federal Government, particularly those affecting the rights and safety of the public.3\n1. OVERVIEW\nWhile AI is improving operations and service delivery across the Federal Government, agencies must effectively manage its use. As such, this memorandum establishes new agency requirements and guidance for AI governance, advancement, and risk management, including through specific minimum risk management practices for uses of AI that impact the rights and safety of the public.\nStrengthening AI Governance. Managing AI risk and promoting AI advancement requires effective AI governance. As required by Executive Order 14110, each agency must designate a Chief AI Officer (CAIO) within 60 days of the date of the issuance of this memorandum. This memorandum describes the roles, responsibilities, seniority, position, and reporting structures for agency CAIOs, including expanded reporting through agency AI use case inventories. Because AI is deeply interconnected with other technical and policy areas including data, information technology (IT), security, privacy, civil rights and civil liberties, customer experience, and workforce management, CAIOs must work in close coordination with existing responsible officials and organizations within their agencies.\nAdvancing Responsible AI advancement. With appropriate safeguards in place, AI can be a helpful tool for modernizing agency operations and improving Federal Government service to the public. To that end, agencies must increase their capacity to responsibly adopt AI, including generative AI, and take steps to enable sharing and reuse of AI models, code, and data. This memorandum requires each agency identified in the Chief Financial Officers Act (CFO Act)4 to develop an enterprise strategy for how they will advance the responsible use of AI. This memorandum also provides recommendations for how agencies should reduce barriers to the responsible use of AI, including barriers related to IT infrastructure, data, cybersecurity, workforce, and the particular challenges of generative AI.\nManaging Risks from the Use of AI. While agencies will realize significant benefits from AI, they must also manage a range of risks from the use of AI. Agencies are subject to existing risk management requirements relevant to AI, and this memorandum does not replace or supersede these requirements. Instead, it establishes new requirements and recommendations that, both independently and collectively, address the specific risks from relying on AI to inform or carry out agency decisions and actions, particularly when such reliance impacts the rights and safety of the public. To address these risks, this memorandum requires agencies to follow minimum practices when using safety-impacting AI and rights-impacting AI, and enumerates specific categories of AI that are presumed to impact rights and safety. Finally, this memorandum also establishes a series of recommendations for managing AI risks in the context of Federal procurement.", "tags": ["Risk factors: Safety", "Harms: Violation of civil or human rights, including privacy", "Strategies: Disclosure: About evaluation", "Strategies: Government support", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Risk factors: Security: Cybersecurity", "Risk factors: Security: Dissemination", "Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf", "official_name": "Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence", "label": "innov"}

ADVANCING RESPONSIBLE ARTIFICIAL INTELLIGENCE advancement\nIf implemented responsibly, AI can improve operations and deliver efficiencies across the Federal Government. Agencies must improve their ability to use AI in ways that benefit the public and increase mission effectiveness, while recognizing the limitations and risks of AI and when it is not suited for a given task. In particular, agencies are encouraged to prioritize AI development and adoption for the public good and where the technology can be helpful in understanding and tackling large societal challenges, such as using AI to improve the accessibility of government services, reduce food insecurity, address the climate crisis, improve public health, advance equitable outcomes, protect democracy and human rights, and grow economic competitiveness in a way that benefits people across the United States.\nTo achieve this, agencies should build upon existing internal enterprise capacity to 18 support responsible AI advancement, take actions to strengthen their AI and AI-enabling talent, and improve their ability to develop and procure AI. Agencies should both explore joint efforts to scale these opportunities as well as take steps to responsibly share their AI resources across the Federal Government and with the public.\na. AI Strategies\nWithin 365 days of the issuance of this memorandum, each CFO Act agency must develop and release publicly on the agency’s website a strategy for identifying and removing barriers to the responsible use of AI and achieving enterprise-wide improvements in AI maturity, including:\ni. the agency’s current and planned uses of AI that are most impactful to an agency’s mission or service delivery;19\nii. a current assessment of the agency’s AI maturity and the agency’s AI maturity goals;\niii. the agency’s plans to effectively govern its use of AI, including through its Chief AI Officer, AI Governance Boards, and improvements to its AI use case inventory;\niv. a plan for developing sufficient enterprise capacity for AI advancement, including mature AI-enabling infrastructure for the data, computing, development, testing, cybersecurity adherence, deployment, and continuous-monitoring infrastructure necessary to build, test, and maintain AI;\nv. a plan for providing sufficient AI tools and capacity to support the agency’s exploratory work (exploratory work) work consistent with the exploratory work priorities developed by OMB and the Office of Science and Technology Policy, the National AI exploratory work Strategic Plan, and agency-specific exploratory work plans;\nvi. a plan for establishing operational and governance processes as well as developing the necessary infrastructure to manage risks from the use of AI;\nvii. a current assessment of the agency’s AI and AI-enabling workforce capacity and projected AI and AI-enabling workforce needs, as well as a plan to recruit, hire, train, retain, and empower AI practitioners and achieve AI literacy for non-practitioners involved in AI to meet those needs;\nviii. the agency’s plan to encourage diverse perspectives throughout the AI development or procurement lifecycle, including how to determine whether a particular use of AI is meeting the agency’s equity goals and civil rights commitments; and\nix. specific, prioritized areas and planning for future AI investment, leveraging the annual budget process as appropriate.", "tags": ["Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Government support: AI workforce-related", "Strategies: Disclosure", "Strategies: Evaluation: Impact assessment", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Strategies: Government support: For R&D"], "source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2024/03/M-24-10-Advancing-Governance-Innovation-and-Risk-Management-for-Agency-Use-of-Artificial-Intelligence.pdf", "official_name": "Advancing Governance, Innovation, and Risk Management for Agency Use of Artificial Intelligence", "label": "innov"}

Experts agree these AI systems are likely to be developed in the coming decades, with many of them believing they will arrive imminently. Loss of human control or malicious use of these AI systems could lead to catastrophic outcomes for all of humanity. Unfortunately, we have not yet developed the necessary science to control and safeguard the use of such advanced intelligence. The global nature of these risks from AI makes it necessary to recognize AI safety as a global public good, and work towards global governance of these risks. Collectively, we must prepare to avert the attendant catastrophic risks that could arrive at any time.\n\nPromising initial steps by the international community show cooperation on AI safety and governance is achievable despite geopolitical tensions. States and AI developers around the world committed to foundational principles to foster responsible development of AI and minimize risks at two intergovernmental summits. Thanks to these summits, states established AI Safety Institutes or similar institutions to advance testing, research and standards-setting.\n\nThese efforts are laudable and must continue. States must sufficiently resource AI Safety Institutes, continue to convene summits and support other global governance efforts. However, states must go further than they do today. As an initial step, states should develop authorities to detect and respond to AI incidents and catastrophic risks within their jurisdictions. These domestic authorities should coordinate to develop a global contingency plan to respond to severe AI incidents and catastrophic risks. In the longer term, states should develop an international governance regime to prevent the development of models that could pose global catastrophic risks.\n\nDeep and foundational research needs to be conducted to guarantee the safety of advanced AI systems. This work must begin swiftly to ensure they are developed and validated prior to the advent of advanced AIs. To enable this, we call on states to carve out AI safety as a cooperative area of academic and technical activity, distinct from broader geostrategic competition on development of AI capabilities.", "tags": ["Risk factors: Safety", "Harms: Harm to health/safety", "Strategies: Convening", "Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://idais.ai/dialogue/idais-venice/", "official_name": "Consensus Statement on AI Safety as a Global Public Good", "label": "innov"}

It is therefore the policy of the United States Government to enhance advancement and competition by bolstering key drivers of AI progress, such as technical talent and computational power.\n\n     (b)  It is the policy of the United States Government that advancing the lawful ability of noncitizens highly skilled in AI and related fields to enter and work in the United States constitutes a national security priority.  Today, the unparalleled United States AI industry rests in substantial part on the insights of brilliant scientists, engineers, and entrepreneurs who moved to the United States in pursuit of academic, social, and economic opportunity.

Purpose.  Artificial intelligence (AI) is a defining technology of our era.  Recent advancements in AI demonstrate its rapidly growing relevance to national security, including with respect to logistics, military capabilities, intelligence analysis, and cybersecurity.  Building AI in the United States will help prevent adversaries from gaining access to, and using, powerful future systems to the detriment of our military and national security.  It will also enable the United States Government to continue harnessing AI in service of national-security missions while preventing the United States from becoming dependent on other countries’ infrastructure to develop and operate powerful AI tools.\n\nAdvances at the frontier of AI will also have significant implications for United States economic competitiveness.  These imperatives require building AI infrastructure in the United States on the time frame needed to ensure United States leadership over competitors who, already, are racing to take the lead in AI development and adoption.  Building AI in the United States requires enormous private-sector investments in infrastructure, especially for the advanced computing clusters needed to train AI models and the energy infrastructure needed to power this work.

To do so, it is necessary to observe models in their deployed context and to monitor how the AI ecosystem is evolving. These observations feed into the work of assessing the adequacy of our mitigations for deployed models, and the efficacy of our Framework. We will update our Framework based on these observations.\n\nWe track the latest technical developments in frontier AI capabilities and evaluation, including through engagement with peer companies and the wider AI community of academics, policymakers, civil society organizations, and governments. We expect to update our Framework as our collective understanding of how to measure and mitigate potential catastrophic risk from frontier AI develops, including related to state actors. This might involve adding, removing, or updating catastrophic outcomes or threat scenarios, or changing the ways in which we prepare models to be evaluated. We may choose to reevaluate certain models in line with our revised Framework.\n\n5.2\tResearch areas of focus\n\nAs discussed above, we recognize that more research should be done - both within Meta and in the broader ecosystem - around how to measure and manage risk effectively in the development of frontier AI models. To that end, we'll continue to work on: (1) improving the quality and reliability of evaluations; (2) developing additional, robust mitigation techniques; and (3) more advanced methods for performing post-release monitoring of open source AI models.", "tags": ["Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://ai.meta.com/static-resource/meta-frontier-ai-framework", "official_name": "Meta Frontier AI Framework (Version 1.1)", "label": "innov"}

It is the value concepts and behavioral norms that S&T activities must abide by, and an important assurance for the healthy development of S&T undertakings. The following opinions are put forward in order to further strengthen the governance of S&T ethics, effectively prevent ethical risks that S&T advancement may bring about, promote science and technology for good ends, and achieve a high level of S&T self-reliance (自立自强).\n\nI.\tOverall Requirements\n\n(1)\tGuiding ideology. Taking Xi Jinping Thought on Socialism with Chinese Characteristics for a New Era as the guide, comprehensively implementing the spirit of the 19th Party Congress and the Second, Third, Fourth, and Fifth Plenums of the 19th Chinese Communist Party (CCP) Central Committee, and conscientiously putting into practice the decisions and arrangements of the CCP Central Committee and the State Council, we shall accelerate the construction of an S&T ethics system with Chinese characteristics, and improve the institutions and mechanisms of S&T ethics governance with multilateral participation and collaborative governance; adhering to the governance principles of unifying advancement promotion and risk prevention, and of combining institutional regulation and self-restraint (自我约束), we shall establish and improve a system of S&T ethics that is consistent with our national conditions and in line with international trends, and shape the cultural concept of tech for social good (科技向善), so as to make science and technology better benefit humanity, and promote the building of a community of common destiny for humanity (人类命运共同体).\n\n(2)\tBasic requirements.\n\n—Ethics first. Promoting S&T ethics requires that it permeate the whole process of scientific research, technological development, and other S&T activities, covering all fields of S&T advancement.\n\n—Agile governance. Strengthen the early warning, tracking, and analysis of S&T ethics risks, and adjust governance methods and ethical norms dynamically in a timely manner, responding quickly and flexibly to the ethical challenges brought about by S&T advancement.\n\n—Be firmly rooted in national conditions. Firmly rooted in the historical stage of China’s S&T development and its social and cultural characteristics, and abiding by the underlying principles of S&T advancement, we shall establish and improve an S&T ethics system that conforms to China’s national conditions.\n\n—Open cooperation.

Determine Necessary Disclosures of AI Use in the Fulfillment of a Government Contract. While this memorandum primarily concerns the deliberate acquisition of AI systems, vendors will likely increasingly utilize AI as part of contract performance in situations where the government may not anticipate the use of that AI.

Agencies are strongly encouraged to use performance-based techniques, as outlined below, to identify requirements and contract terms. Resulting performance-based requirements allow agencies to understand and assess vendor claims about their proposed use of AI systems or services prior to contract award, acquire AI capabilities that address their needs, and perform post-award monitoring. Focusing acquisition on achieving desired performance outcomes directly facilitates an agency's ability to ensure its needs are met by defining metrics to maintain and improve performance of the AI system or service. Performance-based techniques include: \nA. Statements of Objectives (SOO) and Performance Work Statements (PWS). SOO and PWS provide agencies with more flexibility to acquire AI systems or services that meet agencies' outcome-based needs, but may not meet unnecessary or overly-limiting requirements in Statements of Work (SOW). \nB. Quality Assurance Surveillance Plans (QASP). QASPs can help agencies overcome challenges in defining relevant performance metrics pre-solicitation and can enable a more collaborative process for negotiating a QASP that meets agency needs and objects. Government personnel should be prepared to assume a more active role in performance monitoring. \nC. Contract encouragements. Contract encouragements can be used to improve the performance and interoperability of AI systems and services. encouragements can be based on metrics and provisions in QASPs. When determining whether to include performance-based encouragements, agencies must carefully consider whether the established metrics are correctly tied to desired business and mission outcomes, and whether they can adequately measure baseline performance of the AI systems or services.", "tags": ["Strategies: Evaluation", "Applications: Government: other applications/unspecified", "Incentives: Subsidies"], "source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2025/02/M-25-22-Driving-Efficient-Acquisition-of-Artificial-Intelligence-in-Government.pdf", "official_name": "Memorandum 25-22 (Driving Efficient Acquisition of Artificial Intelligence in Government)", "label": "innov"}

This will allow the state to develop approaches to regulating (or, in\ncertain cases, banning) such products that pose unacceptable risks to society, national security, law\nand order, etc. Assessing the effectiveness and efficiency of the provisions of future legislation\nbased on practical experience will allow the state, if not to change the relevant provisions, to adapt their application, for example, by publishing additional explanations or recommendations, or to\nintroduce additional provisions where the relevant nature of social relations requires it and/or\nwhere legislative gaps exist.\n\nTo summarize, we can responsibly expect a comprehensive and multifaceted positive impact from\nthe use of the instruments and confidently approach the second stage – the introduction of\nmandatory regulation.", "tags": ["Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://storage.thedigital.gov.ua/files/c/fc/36c4cae89deedfbf3781ec6bceddffcc.pdf", "official_name": "White Paper on Artificial Intelligence Regulation in Ukraine: Vision of the Ministry of Digital Transformation of Ukraine 2024", "label": "innov"}

{"id": "406_4", "doc_id": "406", "text": "SEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n\nThe Congress finds the following:\n\n\n(1) Artificial intelligence (AI) is a transformative technology that affects nearly every aspect of the United States economy.\n\n\n(2) As AI becomes increasingly ubiquitous, AI literacy will become as important as digital literacy is today.\n\n\n(3) Technological leadership in AI is an economic and national security imperative. Maintaining this leadership requires a sufficient workforce to research and develop AI capabilities. Such a workforce must contain both technical talent, such as computer engineers and data scientists, and nontechnical talent, such as product managers and sales engineers, who understand AI.\n\n\n(4) Effective AI literacy initiatives encompass not only technical training but also include comprehensive education about the potential benefits and risks associated with AI technologies.\n\n\n(5) Informed developers and consumers of AI technologies can help mitigate potential risks and biases often found in systems that utilize AI.\n\n\n(6) Basic AI literacy is critical to ensuring that Americans have the tools and knowledge needed to navigate the economy and digital world. With AI being increasingly adopted by consumer-facing companies and widely used tools on the internet, Americans of all ages and occupations should have the skills and tools needed to understand AI and its limitations at a basic level as well as skills to identify when AI is being employed.\n\n\n(7) Successful AI literacy initiatives will prepare Americans of all ages and technical backgrounds to safely navigate AI tools and AI-enabled technologies.\n\n\n(8) Communities most often negatively impacted by AI-enabled technologies often have the least access to AI education.\n\n\n(9) AI literacy initiatives must engage stakeholders and communities in all stages, and specific outreach efforts should be made for communities disproportionately impacted by the digital divide, including minority and rural communities.\n\n\n(10) According to a survey of adults commissioned by Jobs for the Future, a non-profit organization with a focus on workforce development and education, 58 percent believe that learning opportunities around AI should be offered to workers, 53 percent believe that such opportunities should be available to learners, and 54 percent believe that they would feel more prepared for the future impact of AI if they were given learning tools for it.\n\n\n(11) As of 2018, the United States AI workforce stood at about 14,000,000 workers, or about 9 percent of total employment. From 2019 to 2029, demand for AI occupations is projected to grow twice as fast as for all occupations in the United States.\n\n\n(12) In 2021, Black students made up only 7.5 percent of AI-related bachelor’s degrees despite making up 14 percent of the population. While women account for 60 percent of college graduates, they constitute only 40 percent of Science, Technology, Engineering, and Mathematics graduates and 25 percent of graduates in AI fields. Efforts in AI literacy can help to bridge stark differences in attainment across demographic groups.\n\n\n(13) The need for a strong workforce of AI workers, as well as an AI-literate population, requires investment in AI literacy education.", "tags": ["Strategies: Government support", "Strategies: Government support: AI workforce-related", "Applications: Education", "Strategies: Government support: For R&D", "Strategies: Government support", "Applications: Education", "Strategies: Government support: AI workforce-related", "Strategies: Government support: For R&D", "Strategies: Government study or report"], "source": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/6791", "official_name": "Artificial Intelligence Literacy Act of 2023", "label": "innov"}

Findings.\n\nCongress makes the following findings:\n\n(1) A 2019 Government Accountability Office report found that while there are many Federal employment and training programs, their total financial support levels remain at nearly $20,000,000,000, or less than 0.1 percent of the gross domestic product of the United States.\n\n(2) The number of workers receiving federally supported training has declined in the past 3 decades as advances in technology have simultaneously shifted labor market demand over time.\n\n(3) Job losses from automation are more likely to impact women, people of color, and workers making less than $40,000 annually.\n\n(4) The COVID–19 pandemic accelerated trends in automation, with 43 percent of businesses in the World Economic Forum’s Future of Jobs survey indicating they plan to reduce their workforce as a result of technology integration.\n\n(5) Strong Federal investment in expanding training services for workers whose jobs may be lost due to automation could prepare the United States workforce to better adapt to changes in the labor market and enter into skilled positions in technologically oriented occupations and industries.\n\n(6) A focus on preparing the workforce of the United States for jobs that utilize advanced technologies and require digital literacy could grow wages, increase economic productivity, and boost the competitiveness of the United States.\n\n(7) Studies show that the United States would need to invest $72,000,000,000 more annually just to reach the average investment in workforce policies of other industrial countries. For training alone, the United States would need to invest nearly $8,500,000,000 just to reach the average amount invested by member countries of the Organisation on Economic Co-operation and Development.", "tags": ["Strategies: Government support", "Harms: Financial loss", "Strategies: Pilots and testbeds", "Harms: Financial loss", "Strategies: Government support", "Strategies: Government support", "Harms: Financial loss", "Strategies: Pilots and testbeds", "Applications: Transportation", "Applications: Manufacturing and process automation", "Strategies: Government support", "Harms: Financial loss", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Harms: Financial loss"], "source": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/5350", "official_name": "Investing in Tomorrow's Workforce Act of 2023", "label": "innov"}

SHORT TITLE.\n\n\nThis Act may be cited as the “Humane and Existing Alternatives in Research and Testing Sciences Act of 2022” or the “HEARTS Act of 2022”.\n\n\nSEC. 2. FINDINGS.\n\n\nCongress finds the following:\n\n\n(1) The National Institutes of Health (NIH) has supported life-saving research that has greatly improved the health and well-being not only of Americans but also of people around the world.\n\n\n(2) Much of this research has relied on animals. It is estimated that between 17,000,000 and 100,000,000 animals are used annually in the United States in research, education, and testing. However, the precise number of animals used in research in the United States is unknown. Such imprecise numbers make it impossible to effectively track and reduce the numbers of animals used.\n\n\n(3) According to the NIH, “approximately 30 percent of promising medications have failed in human clinical trials because they are found to be toxic despite promising pre-clinical studies in animal models. About 60 percent of candidate drugs fail due to lack of efficacy.”. These statistics indicate that new, human-focused biology is needed.\n\n\n(4) The laboratory use of animals has also long been a matter of public concern because, among other things, there is very little publicly available data provided by the NIH about the number and species of animals used in research.\n\n\n(5) Effective alternatives to animals are becoming available, and their number is growing. Cutting-edge technologies have forged new frontiers in toxicology, biology, and medicine that have produced human-relevant models, including organoid cell cultures, multiphysiological systems, genomics, induced pluripotent adult stem cells, 3D modeling with human cells, molecular imaging, computer models, in silico trials, digital imaging, artificial intelligence, and other innovative methods, all of which have launched a technological revolution in biomedical research.\n\n\n(6) The Animal Welfare Act (Public Law 89–544) requires researchers to consider alternatives to animal use for painful procedures and stresses that researchers should not unnecessarily duplicate previous experiments. However, oversight is lacking, and these provisions are not implemented the way that Congress intended. As a result, researchers are not capitalizing on nonanimal models that might more effectively recapitulate human biology.\n\n\n(7) A system of active encouragements is needed to encourage researchers to develop and utilize humane, cost-effective, and scientifically suitable nonanimal methods based on human biology.\n\n\n(8) Further, under the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–43), the NIH is supposed to outline a plan for reducing the use of animals in research. Section 404C(a)(1) of the Public Health Service Act (42 U.S.C. 283e(a)(1)), as added by section 205 of the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993, calls for the NIH to “conduct or support research into… methods of biomedical research and experimentation that do not require the use of animals [and] methods of such research and experimentation that reduce the number of animals used in such research”.\n\n\n(9) A dedicated center that provides resources, financial support, and training to encourage researchers to utilize humane, cost-effective, and scientifically suitable nonanimal methods based on human biology will result in more progress toward understanding human diseases and their treatments and cures. It will complete the vision that Congress set out in the National Institutes of Health Revitalization Act of 1993 (Public Law 103–43), which has been thwarted because of lack of oversight.", "tags": ["Strategies: New institution", "Strategies: Government support: For R&D", "Strategies: Government support: AI workforce-related", "Strategies: Convening", "Applications: Medicine, life sciences and public health", "Strategies: Government support"], "source": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/house-bill/1024", "official_name": "HEARTS Act of 2022", "label": "innov"}

FINDINGS; SENSE OF CONGRESS.\n(a) Findings.—Congress makes the following findings:\n(1) The Islamic Republic of Iran has the largest ballistic missile arsenal in the Middle East, which Iran uses to threaten forces of the United States and partners of the United States in the region.\n(2) Iran is progressing toward developing an intercontinental ballistic missile (commonly referred to an “ICBM”) capability. In 2023, the Defense Intelligence Agency reported that Iran’s progress on its space-launch vehicles shortens the time needed for Iran to produce an ICBM since space-launch vehicles and ICBMs use similar technologies.\n(3) Iran continues to rely on illicit foreign procurement to support its long-range missile aspirations. For example, Iran recently tried to purchase from the Russian Federation and the People’s Republic of China ammonium perchlorate, which is the main ingredient in solid propellants to power missiles.\n(4) Iran relies at least in part on networks in Hong Kong and the People's Republic of China to procure dual-use materials and equipment for its longer-range ballistic missile program.\n(5) North Korea historically has played a role in supporting longer-range Iranian ballistic missile capabilities. Specifically, North Korea provided the Nodong-A to Iran in the 1990s, which Iran used to develop both its first nuclear-capable medium-range ballistic missile and liquid propellant engines for its space-launch vehicles.\n(6) While the Iran Space Agency, a government organization subject to sanctions, develops space capabilities for Iran’s ministry of defense as well as the communications sector, Iran’s Revolutionary Guard Corps Aerospace Force (commonly referred to as the “IRGC–AF”) runs a parallel space program employing solid-propellant motors, which if used in ICBM technology, would enable launches with little warning.\n(7) Iran continues work on larger diameter solid-propellant motors, like the Rafa’e, and is now reportedly in the possession of an all-solid-propellant space-launch vehicle called the Qaem–100. The Qaem–100 was reportedly tested twice, once in November 2022 and again in March 2023.\n(8) The IRGC–AF last successfully launched a satellite into orbit in September 2023 using its Qased rocket, fueled by both liquid- and solid-fueled stages.\n(9) Iran’s development, production, and transfer of space-launch vehicle and ballistic missile technology violated Annex B of United Nations Security Council Resolution 2231 (2015), which enshrined certain restrictions under the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. Those restrictions expired on October 18, 2023.", "tags": ["Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Convening", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Government study or report", "Strategies: Evaluation", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Applications: Government: military and public safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Strategies: Government study or report"], "source": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/118th-congress/senate-bill/3334", "official_name": "No ICBMs or Drones for Iran Act of 2023", "label": "innov"}

This framework outlines practices for different actors along the AI value chain to enable them to identify and disclose when content is AI-generated, such as labels, and watermarks, amongst others.\nWe have also developed our own policies on AI-generated content. For our AIs and AI stickers, for example, we provide a clear notice so people know when they are interacting with an AI and can choose not to engage. We include visible indicators on photorealistic images generated by these experiences to help reduce the chances of people confusing these images with human-generated content. Examples of these indicators include a visible burnt-in watermark on content from the image generator built into our Meta AI assistant, and appropriate in-product measures for other generative AI features. This approach may evolve over time as we learn more about the needs of our community.\nWe are developing additional techniques to include information on the source of generated images, a concept known as provenance, as part of individual image files. Some of this work is reflected in the image generator built into our Meta AI assistant at launch, but we intend to expand to other experiences as the technology improves. We’re also working with other companies to standardise provenance signalling so it’s possible to provide additional context when images are distributed across different companies’ platforms.\nIn chats with AIs at Meta, people are able to access additional information about the AI, including how it generates content, the limitations of the AI, and how the data they have shared with the AI is used via in-product education. More information is available in Meta’s Help Center and Meta’s Privacy Center.\nOur Generative AI system cards include information for consumers about Meta’s generative AI systems, including an overview of the system, a section describing how it works, an interactive demo, usage tips, information on data usage, and what to be aware of when using generative AI in Meta’s products.

{"id": "765_1", "doc_id": "765", "text": "Preparedness Framework\nFrontier AI models have the potential to benefit all of humanity, but also pose increasingly severe risks. To manage these risks as AI models continue to improve, we are developing a Preparedness Framework, which deepens our proactive, risk-based approach to responsible frontier model development, especially in relation to catastrophic risks. \nThe Preparedness Framework will detail our approach to developing rigorous frontier model capability evaluations and monitoring, as well as establishing a governance structure for accountability and oversight across the development process. The risks we plan to track as part of this policy span multiple categories including cybersecurity, persuasion, chemical and biological threats, and autonomy. \nThe Preparedness Framework will also provide for a spectrum of actions to protect against catastrophic outcomes. The empirical understanding of catastrophic risk is nascent and developing rapidly. We will thus be dynamically updating our assessment of current frontier model risk levels to ensure we reflect our latest evaluation and monitoring understanding. We are standing up a dedicated team (Preparedness) that drives this effort, including performing necessary research and monitoring.  \nThe Preparedness Framework is meant to complement and extend our existing risk mitigation work, which contributes to the safety and alignment of new, highly capable systems, both before and after deployment. These existing efforts include the work of our Safety Systems team to conduct research and build systematic solutions to ensure our best models can be deployed safely and our Superalignment team, which focuses on the machine learning challenges of aligning superintelligent AI systems with human intent. \nThey also include a joint Deployment Safety Board (DSB) with Microsoft, which approves decisions by either party to deploy models above a certain capability threshold. The DSB focuses specifically on deployment decisions rather than on earlier steps such as deciding whether or not to train models of a certain scale or capability level. It has some of the features that are often discussed in the context of responsible scaling policies, such as a focus on the most capable systems, a strong emphasis on adversarial testing, and explicit consideration of alignment. We have learned valuable lessons from the DSB's review of GPT-4, which was the first eligible deployment, and will be using those lessons to inform the design and implementation of the Preparedness Framework. Both the DSB and the Preparedness Framework, and their respective roles, may evolve over time as we learn more about risks and mitigations.\nNote: We refer to our policy as a Preparedness Framework rather than a Responsible Scaling Policy because we can experience dramatic increases in capability without significant increase in scale, e.g., via algorithmic improvements. The Preparedness Framework governs our development of increasingly capable frontier models regardless of whether those increasing capabilities stem from scale, algorithmic improvements, or other optimizations.", "tags": ["Risk factors: Security", "Risk factors: Security: Cybersecurity", "Risk factors: Safety", "Harms: Harm to health/safety", "Strategies: Evaluation", "Strategies: Evaluation: Adversarial testing", "Strategies: Evaluation: Impact assessment", "Strategies: Convening", "Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://openai.com/global-affairs/our-approach-to-frontier-risk/", "official_name": "OpenAI's Approach to Frontier Risk (An Update for the UK AI Safety Summit)", "label": "innov"}

An ASL Standard is a set of technical and operational measures for safely training and deploying frontier AI models. As model capabilities increase, so will the need for stronger safeguards, which are captured in successively higher ASL Standards. Deﬁnitions of ASL Standards and other key terms are available in Appendix A.\nThe types of measures that compose an ASL Standard currently fall into two categories–Deployment Standards and Security Standards–which map onto the types of risks that frontier AI models may pose.\n\n- Deployment Standards: Deployment Standards are technical, operational, and policy measures to ensure the safe usage of AI models by external users (i.e., our users and customers) as well as internal users (i.e., our employees). Deployment Standards aim to strike a balance between enabling beneﬁcial use of AI technologies and mitigating the risks of potentially catastrophic cases of misuse.\n- Security Standards: Security Standards are technical, operational, and policy measures to protect AI models–particularly their weights and associated systems–from unauthorized access, theft, or compromise by malicious actors. Security Standards are intended to maintain the integrity and controlled use of AI models throughout their lifecycle, from development to deployment.\nWe expect to continue reﬁning our framework in response to future risks (for example, the risk that an AI system attempts to subvert the goals of its operators).", "tags": ["Strategies: Tiering", "Risk factors: Security", "Risk factors: Security: Dissemination", "Risk factors: Safety", "Strategies: Tiering: Tiering based on impact", "Risk factors: Security: Cybersecurity", "Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://assets.anthropic.com/m/24a47b00f10301cd/original/Anthropic-Responsible-Scaling-Policy-2024-10-15.pdf", "official_name": "Anthropic Responsible Scaling Policy", "label": "innov"}

We will test for this checkpoint and, by the time we reach it, we aim to have met (or be close to meeting) the ASL-3 Security Standard as an intermediate goal, and we will share an update on our progress around that time. At that point, we will also specify Required Safeguards for this Capability Threshold in more detail, update our list of Capability Thresholds to consider additional risks that may arise, and test for the full Autonomous AI exploratory work Capability Threshold and any additional risks.\n\nWe will also maintain a list of capabilities that we think require signiﬁcant investigation and may require stronger safeguards than ASL-2 provides. This group of capabilities could pose serious risks, but the exact Capability Threshold and the Required Safeguards are not clear at present. These capabilities may warrant a higher standard of safeguards, such as the ASL-3 Security or Deployment Standard.\nHowever, it is also possible that by the time these capabilities are reached, there will be evidence that such a standard is not necessary (for example, because of the potential use of similar capabilities for defensive purposes).

The Framework is exploratory and based on preliminary research, which we hope will contribute to and benefit from the broader scientific conversation. It will be reviewed periodically and we expect it to evolve substantially as our understanding of the risks and benefits of frontier models improves.\n\nThe Framework is informed by the broader conversation on Responsible Capability Scaling. The core components of Responsible Capability Scaling are to:\n\n- Identify capability levels at which AI models pose heightened risk without additional mitigations\n- Implement protocols to detect the attainment of such capability levels\n- Prepare and aticulate mitigation plans in advance for when such capability levels are attained\n- Where appropriate, involve external paties in the process to help inform and guide our approach.\n\nWe are piloting this initial version of the Frontier Safety Framework as a first step to operationalizing these principles.\n\nTable of contents:\n\n[Omitted.]", "tags": ["Strategies: Pilots and testbeds"], "source": "https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/fsf-technical-report.pdf", "official_name": "Google DeepMind Frontier Safety Framework Version 1.0", "label": "innov"}

Future work will aim to include additional pressing risks, with possible examples including:\n   - Misaligned AI: protection against the risk of systems acting adversarially against humans may require additional Framework components, including new evaluations and control mitigations that protect against adversarial AI activity.\n   - Chemical, radiological, and nuclear risks: Poweful capabilities in each of these domains are currently covered by existing model evaluations that Google DeepMind is already implementing, and they are potential candidates for inclusion into the Framework.\n   - Higher CCLs: as AI progress continues, we may approach more advanced capabilities within existing domains, especially when present CCLs are close to being breached.\n- Involving external authorities and expets: We are exploring internal policies around aleting relevant stakeholder bodies when, for example, evaluation thresholds are met, and in some cases mitigation plans as well as post-mitigation outcomes. We will also explore how to appropriately involve independent third paties in our risk assessment and mitigation processes.\n \nAcknowledgements\n\n[Omitted.]", "tags": ["Risk factors: Safety", "Strategies: Governance development", "Strategies: Convening", "Strategies: Evaluation", "Strategies: Disclosure: About evaluation", "Strategies: Disclosure: About incidents", "Strategies: Disclosure: In deployment", "Strategies: Disclosure"], "source": "https://storage.googleapis.com/deepmind-media/DeepMind.com/Blog/introducing-the-frontier-safety-framework/fsf-technical-report.pdf", "official_name": "Google DeepMind Frontier Safety Framework Version 1.0", "label": "innov"}
