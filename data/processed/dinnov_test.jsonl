However, privacy is a good starting point. To comply with privacy law, you need to be confident that you understand potential privacy risks and that you’re upholding the IPPs. This is why we expect organisations to do a privacy impact assessment (PIA) before using AI tools.\nA privacy impact assessment will help you use AI tools more effectively\nTo use AI tools effectively, you need some understanding about how they work. That includes what data sources they were trained on, and how relevant and reliable these sources are for your purposes. OPC offers guidance on writing a PIA, which is a good way to consider these questions, and to bring up and address potential risks for privacy, transparency, and trust. Doing a good PIA might also involve talking with people and communities who your work will impact.\nWe have tools on our website privacy.org.nz to help you develop a PIA.\nOnce you understand the potential risks, you can:\n• Use privacy policies to govern your AI tools.\n• Ensure privacy statements set clear expectations.\nConsidering Te Ao Māori perspectives\nYou need to consider Māori perspectives on privacy.4 We recommend you’re proactive in how you engage. We’ve heard specific concerns about Māori privacy and AI tools, including:\n• Concerns about bias from systems developed overseas that do not work accurately for Māori.\n• Collection of Māori information without work to build relationships of trust, leading to inaccurate\nrepresentation of Māori taonga that fail to uphold tapu and tikanga.\n• Exclusion from processes and decisions of building and adopting AI tools that affect Māori whānau, hapū, and iwi, including use of these tools by the Crown.\nNext steps: we’re keen to kōrero\nWe are continuing to monitor developments in the use of AI tools and their privacy impacts, and plan to update our guidance over time.

You may need privacy breach response plans to ensure you can notice, contain, assess, and respond to privacy breaches quickly, to mitigate potential harm to individuals and comply with the Act.\nAccess and correction\nWhen an agency holds information about them, a person can ask for that information (IPP6). The agency must generally give someone access to their information, unless there is a reason to withhold it. A person can also ask you to correct information about them (IPP7).\nSome uses of AI tools may make it hard to comply with the access and correction principles. Building AI tools involves processing training data to build models that do pattern-matching. The original training data, the pre-trained model, and the outputs may all potentially contain personal information while providing no practical way to access or correct it, and still posing a risk of disclosure or influencing outcomes for a person in response to particular prompts.\nIt is essential that you develop procedures for how your agency will respond to requests from individuals to access and correct their personal information. You also need to check you are providing information to the correct individual. AI tools may make it easier to realistically impersonate someone and someone and request access to their information.\n• How might AI tools affect the risk of privacy breaches?\n• Are you managing security risks?\nKey questions for access and correction. At the procurement stage, before you put an AI tool into use, you might consider the following:\n• Are you confident you can provide information about a person to them if they ask for it?\n• Are you confident that you can correct personal information?\n• How often are models you rely on updated?

Artificial intelligence (AI) is rapidly transforming the modern world, driving innovation across industries, enhancing productivity, and reshaping the way we live and work.  To ensure the United States remains a global leader in this technological revolution, we must provide our Nation’s youth with opportunities to cultivate the skills and understanding necessary to use and create the next generation of AI technology.  By fostering AI competency, we will equip our students with the foundational knowledge and skills necessary to adapt to and thrive in an increasingly digital society.  Early learning and exposure to AI concepts not only demystifies this powerful technology but also sparks curiosity and creativity, preparing students to become active and responsible participants in the workforce of the future and nurturing the next generation of American AI innovators to propel our Nation to new heights of scientific and economic achievement.\nTo achieve this vision, we must also invest in our educators and equip them with the tools and knowledge to not only train students about AI, but also to utilize AI in their classrooms to improve educational outcomes.  Professional development programs focused on AI education will empower educators to confidently guide students through this complex and evolving field.  Educators, industry leaders, and employers who rely on an AI-skilled workforce should partner to create educational programs that equip students with essential AI skills and competencies across all learning pathways.  While AI education in kindergarten through twelfth grade (K-12) is critical, our Nation must also make resources available for lifelong learners to develop new skills for a changing workforce.  By establishing a strong framework that integrates early student exposure with comprehensive teacher training and other resources for workforce development, we can ensure that every American has the opportunity to learn about AI from the earliest stages of their educational journey through postsecondary education, fostering a culture of innovation and critical thinking that will solidify our Nation’s leadership in the AI-driven future.", "tags": ["Strategies: Government support", "Strategies: Government support: AI workforce-related", "Strategies: Governance development"], "source": "https://www.whitehouse.gov/presidential-actions/2025/04/advancing-artificial-intelligence-education-for-american-youth/", "official_name": "Advancing Artificial Intelligence Education for American Youth", "label": "innov"}

Research on digital forensics is also needed to identify, preserve, recover, and analyze the provenance of digital artifacts.\n\t(2) The National Science Foundation's focus to support research in artificial intelligence through computer and information science and engineering, cognitive science and psychology, economics and game theory, control theory, linguistics, mathematics, and philosophy, is building a better understanding of how new technologies are shaping the society and economy of the United States.\n\t(3) The National Science Foundation has identified the 10 Big Ideas for NSF Future Investment'' including Harnessing the Data Revolution'' and the ``Future of Work at the Human-\nTechnology Frontier'', with artificial intelligence is a critical component.\n\t(4) The outputs generated by generative adversarial networks should be included under the umbrella of research described in paragraph (3) given the grave national security and societal impact potential of such networks.\n\t(5) Generative adversarial networks are not likely to be utilized as the sole technique of artificial intelligence or machine learning capable of creating credible deepfakes. Other techniques may be developed in the future to produce similar outputs.", "tags": ["Risk factors: Safety", "Risk factors: Security", "Harms: Violation of civil or human rights, including privacy", "Harms: Detrimental content", "Strategies: Government support", "Strategies: Government support: For R&D", "Strategies: Convening", "Applications: Government: military and public safety"], "source": "https://www.congress.gov/bill/116th-congress/senate-bill/2904/text", "official_name": "Identifying Outputs of Generative Adversarial Networks Act", "label": "innov"}
